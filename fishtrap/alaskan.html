<h1>  <h1>
<body>
    
<center><h2>You're someone with a tough exterior but a soft heart. Much like the king crab, you are strong and resilient, thriving even in the harshest conditions. You are protective of those close to you, acting as a shield for your loved ones. Though you can seem guarded or defensive at times, it's only because you're strategic, always thinking several steps ahead. You prefer a structured approach to life and are highly adaptable in the face of challenges.</h2></center>

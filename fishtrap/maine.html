<center><h2>You're someone who is tough and determined, much like the lobster that thrives in the rocky coastal waters. Youâ€™re known for your strong work ethic and your ability to adapt to challenges with patience and persistence. While you may come off as guarded at times, those who know you understand that you're deeply caring and protective of your loved ones. You appreciate stability and are not easily shaken by life's ups and downs. You're loyal, practical, and always ready to take on whatever comes your way.</h2></center>

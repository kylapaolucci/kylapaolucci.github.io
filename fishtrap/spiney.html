    Youâ€™re a complex individual who thrives in varied environments, often preferring to observe rather than be in the spotlight. Like the spiny eel, you have a unique charm and depth that may take time to discover. You might come off as reserved or cautious, but once you feel comfortable, you reveal your true self. You value your independence and may set boundaries, but those who take the time to understand you will find a loyal and resourceful friend.

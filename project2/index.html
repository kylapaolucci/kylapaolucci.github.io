        	<h2>Project 2: Basic Build</h2>

<p>
Compared to the web experiences and app interactions we have today, the early web (web 2.0) looks pretty basic. Internet technologies continually evolve, becoming more sophisticated and complex. But at least one aspect of the web has remained essential from its earliest days until now: the hyperlink, connecting one document to another.</p>

<p>In this project, you will explore the design possibilities of basic web code (HTML), focusing on the interactive possibilities of the hyperlink while creating an experience that is basic and brutalist, down to its very roots.</p> 

<br>
<strong>Topics Covered</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic HTML</li>
<li>Brutalist Web</li>
<li>Wireframes</li>
<li>User Journeys</li>
 </ul>
<br>
<strong>Instructions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create a website with multiple pages linked together, resulting in a well-considered interaction between the user and the computer. The primary emphasis of your design should be on the interactions created by your links. However, visual design is also important within the limits of what our basic code levels allow. The site should lead users through an experience with a clear start and end, allowing users to feel like they are doing something, that the computer is responding accordingly, and that the user’s choices actually affect the outcome.</li>
<li>Begin with the word “basic.” Think of all the synonyms that may arise from word association. A prevalent synonym may be “mid.” An old-school synonym might be “plain” or “run-of-the-mill.” This will serve as brainstorming for your content.</li>
<li>The following are possible concepts for your site:</li>
<ul class="second-ul">
	<li class="second-li">Tutorial to accomplish a task where each step of the process has multiple choices (not just one or two options)</li>
<li class="second-li">Game where users choose different options leading to different possible endings</li>
<li class="second-li">Quiz or test</li>
<li class="second-li">Basic version of a realistic app/web service</li>
<li class="second-li">A photo album or storybook</li></ul>

<li>Your site should meet the following specifications to create a strong interaction:</li>
<ul class="second-ul">
	<li class="second-li">
Minimum 30 pages (html files)</li>
	<li class="second-li">After each user action (click), incorporate some feedback to make it clear the computer “understood” the action
	<li class="second-li">Pages should avoid single-link pages as much as possible, as this does not give the user a sense of choice, and instead focus on giving multiple options for each possible action
	<li class="second-li">Incorporate sensible navigation: make it clear how to select one option vs another, and consider adding links going back one step, back to the start, etc.
	<li class="second-li">Do not use CSS, inline styles, or JavaScript. Do not copy code from outside sources in this or other projects for this class. For this project, the only visual styling you are allowed to do should be from images you put in. Again, while visual design does matter, the primary focus is on your content and use of links to create an experience. A project that has very interesting use of links and weak typography will receive a higher grade than a project with better typography but uninspired interactions (and highest grades will go to students who do both).
	<li class="second-li">Finally, code this project from scratch in a plain text editor like Sublime Text or Text Wrangler.</li></li></ul></ul>

<strong>
Deliverables</strong>
<ul><li>
Site map diagram of your pages and how they link</li>
<li>Working HTML pages</li></ul>
 <br>

<strong>Timeline and Milestones</strong>
<ul><li>
<b>Sept 23</b>
<br>Project handout. Brainstorm & Lecture</li>

<li>
<b>Sep 26</b>
<br>Present two project ideas. Show your content “mapped out” for each ideas. Support these maps with at least 2 rough drafts done in Figma of how you envision the pages will look using 1440x1040 frames (desktop size). Keep it basic.</li>

<li>
<b>Sep 30</b>
<br>First 5 pages of website coded and uploaded to GitHub</li>

<li>
<b>Oct 3</b>
<br>Present site in progress, about 50% coded and on GitHub
Site map first draft, done in Figma</li>
<li>
<b>Oct 7</b>
Final deliverables due for critique</li></ul>

<br>
<strong>
Grading Criteria</strong>

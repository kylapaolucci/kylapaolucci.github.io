            <h2>Project 4: Collection Curation</h2>

<p>
From the interconnected webrings of the 1990s to the meticulously crafted Spotify playlists of today, the essence of digital media lies in curation and collection. As we explored in our first project, placing content on a platform inevitably transforms its meaning and experience. Platforms do not merely host content—they shape it.
</p>

<p>For this project, you will design your own mini-platform: a website that organizes and showcases a collection of your choice or creation in an interactive, engaging format. Through this process, you will consider how design choices influence the way audiences interact with and interpret collections.
</p> 

<p>Examples of collections and containers:
<ul>
<li>Frames in a film</li>
<li>Pages in a book</li>
<li>Images in a carousel</li>
<li>Verses in a song</li>
<li>Clothes in a closet</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>Artists & Inspiration:
<ul>
<li>Simon Evans: Detailed, layered works exploring documentation and narrative.</li>
<li>Zines: DIY publications as curated platforms for self-expression.</li>
<li>Everyday Documentation: Photographic practices that catalog daily life.</li>
<li>Rob Stenson: Innovative multimedia artist blending sound, design, and interaction.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>This project invites you to think critically about the intersections of content, form, and platform. How does your chosen collection take shape through your design choices? How might interactivity reshape its meaning for the audience?</p>

<br>
<strong>Topics Covered</strong>
<ul>
<li>Archiving</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Content Curation</li>
 </ul>

<br>
<strong>Instructions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Find or curate a collection of objects, images, drawings, texts, quotations, sounds, videos, or anything that interests you. Research the collection (even if it is your own) to answer the following questions:</li>
<ul class="second-ul">
    <li class="second-li">What makes the objects a collection?</li>
<li class="second-li">Who began the collection? Why? How?</li>
<li class="second-li">What makes this collection interesting?</li>
<li class="second-li">What is an attribute(s) of the collection you could organize it by?</li></ul>

<li>Use all the skills we have developed in our previous projects, such as considerate use of links, visual form, and typography to design and code a website for your collection. Consider questions such as the following as you design it:</li>
<ul class="second-ul">
    <li class="second-li">
What aspects of the collection will your site emphasize?</li>
    <li class="second-li">How will the collection be visually organized?</li>
    <li class="second-li">How will visitors interact with the collection: in a prescribed linear manner, or will they make their own way through?</li>
    <li class="second-li">And crucially: How can graphic design and interaction be used toadd value to this collection?</li></ul>
<li>The answers to all of the above questions should guide your design as you make the site. Note: Do not make a portfolio site.</li></ul>
</li>
